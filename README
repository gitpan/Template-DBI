NAME
    Template::DBI - DBI plugin for the Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
        $ perldoc Template::Plugin::DBI

DESCRIPTION
    The Template-DBI distribution contains the DBI plugin for the Template
    Toolkit. At some point in the future it is likely to contain other
    DBI-related plugins and extension modules for the Template Toolkit.

    The DBI plugin was distributed as part of the Template Toolkit until
    version 2.15 released in May 2006. At this time it was extracted into
    this separate Template-DBI distribution.

    See the documentation for Template::Plugin::DBI for further details on
    using the DBI plugin.

AUTHORS
    The DBI plugin was originally written by Simon A Matthews, and
    distributed as a separate module. It was integrated into the Template
    Toolkit distribution for version 2.00 and included contributions from
    Andy Wardley, Craig Barratt, Dave Hodgkinson and Rafael Kitover. Andy
    Wardley extracted it back into a separate distribution in May 2006.
